> # MyVillager
MyVillager is a simple plugin allowing the players to claim villagers as their own.  
After claiming the villager(s), other players are not able to trade with it.  
The owners can also set up permission group for trusting players.  

This plugin should be used on Spigot or Paper server or any based on Bukkit API.
